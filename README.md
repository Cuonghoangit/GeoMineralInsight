Welcome to the **GeoMineralInsight** repository! This project employs machine learning to analyze geological, geochemical, aeromagnetic, and remote sensing data across 39,000 sq. km in southern India. Our goal is to identify high-probability zones for concealed gold (Au), copper (Cu), and platinum group elements (PGE) deposits. We utilize advanced techniques such as XGBoost, SHAP, and GeoPandas to achieve this.

## Project Overview

GeoMineralInsight focuses on enhancing mineral exploration through data-driven approaches. The project integrates various data sources to provide insights that can guide exploration efforts. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to minimize the risk and cost associated with mineral exploration.

## Key Features

- **Automated Pipelines**: Streamline the data processing workflow to ensure efficiency and accuracy.
- **Explainable AI**: Use SHAP to interpret model predictions, making results understandable and actionable.
- **GIS-Ready Maps**: Generate maps that can be easily integrated into Geographic Information Systems for further analysis.
- **High-Probability Zone Identification**: Pinpoint areas with the highest likelihood of mineral deposits using XGBoost.
- **Data Integration**: Combine geological, geochemical, and remote sensing data for comprehensive analysis.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
- **SHAP**: A tool for interpreting the output of machine learning models.
- **GeoPandas**: An extension of Pandas for geospatial data analysis.
- **Rasterio**: For reading and writing geospatial raster data.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn and others for additional machine learning functionalities.
